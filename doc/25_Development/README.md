# Developing with PimPrint

This chapter gives a quick introduction to implement InDesign document generation with PimPrint:

* [Start developing](#page_Start_developing)
* [REST API](#page_REST_API)
    * [Projects Endpoint](./10_Projects_Endpoint.md)
    * [Project Endpoint](./11_Project_Endpoint.md)
    * [Execute Endpoint](./12_Execute_Endpoint.md)
    * [CustomField Search Endpoint](./13_CustomField_Search_Endpoint.md)
* [Debugging](#page_Debugging)
* [PimPrint with HTTP Proxy](#page_PimPrint_with_HTTP_Proxy)

## Start developing

To start developing with PimPrint good entry points are the fully documented example projects provided with the [PimPrint-Demo](../05_PimPrint-Demo/README.md).
Start with the [demo rendering Services](https://github.com/mds-agenturgruppe/pimprint-demo-bundle/tree/4.x/src/Service) and
perhaps [step through them with a debugger](#page_Debugging).

For a full documented demo of all [Rendering Commands](../15_Rendering_Commands.md) refer to
the [Command demos classes](https://github.com/mds-agenturgruppe/pimprint-demo-bundle/tree/4.x/src/Project/CommandDemo) also included
in [PimPrint-Demo](../05_PimPrint-Demo/README.md).

## REST API

PimPrint InDesign plugin communicates with the server over a REST API.

All endpoints are implemented in `\Mds\PimPrint\CoreBundle\Controller\InDesignController` which exposes this endpoint routes:

```
mds_pimprint_core_indesign_projects 		/pimprint-api/projects
mds_pimprint_core_indesign_project     		/pimprint-api/project/{identifier}
mds_pimprint_core_indesign_executeproject 	/pimprint-api/project/{identifier}/run
mds_pimprint_custom_search                      /pimprint-api/project/{identifier}/custom-search/{customField}
```

* [Projects Endpoint](./10_Projects_Endpoint.md)
* [Project Endpoint](./11_Project_Endpoint.md)
* [Execute Endpoint](./12_Execute_Endpoint.md)
* [CustomField Search Endpoint](./13_CustomField_Search_Endpoint.md)

As PimPrint uses Pimcore User logins for securing access and uses the Pimcore Users and Roles for data access permissions an active Pimcore backend login session is required when
accessing the REST API. Therefore, you have to authenticate with the Pimcore backend first when accessing the REST API with a browser.

## Debugging

To debug, and step analyse the demos and your own projects, you can set your Xdebug extension to autostart on every request by editing your php.ini enabling direct debugging from
InDesign.

 ```ini
;XDebug v2.x
xdebug.remote_autostart = 1

;XDebug v3.x
xdebug.start_with_request = yes
```

The more convenience way is to access the REST API endpoints directly in a browser
and [start the debugging session](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/browser-debugging-extensions.html). Note that an active Pimcore backend login session is required as noted
above.

## PimPrint with HTTP Proxy

By default, PimPrint downloads template and asset files directly from the Pimcore server over HTTP(S) and builds the protocol, hostname and port automatically. In some
circumstances this can fail when Pimcore is running behind an HTTP Proxy and leads to download errors like:
> AssetDownloader Template Error:   
> connect ETIMEDOUT 127.0.0.1:8017   
> http://pimprint-demo.dev:8017/.../PimPrint-DataPrintDemo_blue.indd

For such environments `mds_pimprint_core_bundle` [configuration node](../10_Rendering_Projects/00_Configuration_Reference.md) has the `host` element to configure the used protocol,
hostname and port. Add the configuration matching your infrastructure:

```yaml
mds_pim_print_core:
    host:
        #hostname: ''
        protocol: 'https'
        port: ''
```

This configuration leads to download urls like for the error shown above:

```

```
